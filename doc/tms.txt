Introduction                                                *tms-introduction*

  Motivation                                    *tms-motivation* *tms-purpose*
                                         *tms-vims-power-as-a-user-interfaces*

    People who know VIM (especially those who have discovered explorer.vim)
    are aware of the speed, the customized form and, once learned, the ease of
    issuing commands and processing the results of the commands while in VIM.
    This plugin, The Mail Suite (tms), exploits that power of VIM in the
    domain of electronic mail: for the tasks of sending, receiving and
    organizing mail.

  The Command Set (Overview)                        *tms-command-set-overview*
                                                       *tms-commands-overview*

    Since The Mail Suite builds on VIM's command set, there are only a handful
    of new commands (or tasks):

    1. Get emails (from a POP3 server) and save in raw (.eml) format
    2. Send a buffer (even one without a file) or files as an email (via a SMTP server)
    3. Index (create a ''table of contents'' for) a folder of emails
    4. Open an email from the index (and then open the next or the previous email)
    5. Reply, Forward or Acknowledge an email
    6. Delete, Move or Copy emails

  Contrast of Interfaces for Mail Clients           *tms-interface-contrasted*

    Here's a contrast that makes an aspect of the power of VIM as a user
    interface clear:  other email clients need lots more commands than the
    mail-specific commands listed above since they need to provide a user
    interface;  and their interface is restrictive (compared to that of VIM)
    in regard to the means for navigating and manipulating the stuff on the
    screen and in not allowing keystroke customization.

Users' Guide                                                 *tms-users-guide*

  Preliminaries                                            *tms-preliminaries*

    System Requirements                              *tms-system-requirements*

      TMS has been tested on Windows 98 and Linux.  It requires VIM with perl
      support.  The perl module libnet is required (and one easy way to
      provide this is to have external perl too).

    Download                                                    *tms-download*

      http://www.sonic.net/~suresh/tms/tms.tar.gz

    Installation                                            *tms-installation*

      Essentially, extract the .tar.gz file into the vimfiles directory (on
      Windows) or into the ~/.vim directory (on unix) while preserving folder
      names; then regenerate the help-tags (using the command :helptags).

      Extracting deploys the following files below the vimfiles or .vim
      directory:

            File               |          Contents
      -------------------------+---------------------------------------------
       ftdetect/index.vim      | one line to detect .idx files
       ftplugin/index.vim      | sources mail/tms.vim
       syntax/index.vim        | simple color scheme to distinguish new, old etc.
       plugin/tms.vim          | everything is here
       mail/_tmsrc.example     | configuration of accounts, directories etc.
       mail/tms.vim            | mappings for user-commands -- that's all
       after/ftplugin/mail.vim | folding code; and sources mail/tms.vim
       doc/tms.txt             | documentation

      The help-tags can be regenerated, for example, by executing '':helptags
      $vim\vimfiles\doc'' from within vim.

  Quick-Start Guide                                          *tms-quick-start*

    The Configuration (rc file)                 *tms-configuration* *tms-tmsrc*

      TMS needs configuration information such as mail servers, user names
      etc.  Such information is provided in the tmsrc file.  The default
      location for the tmsrc file is $VIM/vimfiles/mail/_tmsrc (on windows) or
      $HOME/.tmsrc (on unix).  A non-default location can be used by
      specifying it in g:tmsrc.

      The file mail/_tmsrc.example has comments explaining the entries in a tmsrc
      file.

    The Index File                             *tms-index-file* *tms-idx-file*

      The index.idx file lists the .eml files in its directory.

      Columns                                                    *tms-columns*

        The index.idx file can have the following seven columns:

        Column    |  Contents
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Mark      |  [nrah] or any user string
        From      |  The 'From' header of the mail
        To        |  The 'To' header of the mail
        Subject   |  The 'Subject' header of the mail
        date-sEnt |  The 'Sent' header of the mail
        Nick      |  The mail server the mail was sent or received from
        fiLename  |  The name of the mail (*.eml) file

        Note that the name of each column has exactly one capitalized letter.
        If a column is to be present, at least its capitalized letter must be
        specified.  The lower-case letters in a column heading are actually
        ignored.

        Besides the capitalized letter, other special characters in the name of
        a column are '*', digits and sign ('-').  As explained below, the '*' is
        used in determining the width of the column;  and the digit and sign are
        is used in determining the order of sorting the columns.

        The columns are separated by '|'.

        The fiLename column must always be present and it must be the last
        column.  There must be at least one other column.

      Widths                                                      *tms-widths*

        Each column is at least as wide as the distance between the
        column-separators ('|') it is nested inside.  If an entry in the
        column is longer than the width of the column then it is truncated.
        If the name of the column has a '*' then it will be ensured that
        longest entry in the column is fully visible.

      Sort-order                                              *tms-sort-order*

        Names of columns can have digits specifying the order in which they
        are to be sorted.  If sort-order is specified then digits must be used
        consecutively starting from 1.  When a column has a digit specifying
        its sort-order, it can also have a negative sign to specify that the
        entries in the column are sorted in the reverse order.

    Preparing to Send Mail                        *tms-preparing-to-send-mail*
                               *tms-header-for-sending-mail* *tms-send-header*
        
      In general, sending email involves specifying header items such as the
      recipient, the subject etc.  Also, one must specify the SMTP server to
      use to actually send the mail.  In the tmsrc file, one can specify a
      default SMTP server to be used for sending email.  So the one item that
      must be specified for sending each particular email is the
      recipient(s). 

      One prepares the stuff to be sent as shown below.  

              to: [Optional Display Name ]<valid@email.addr> 
              [cc: <value>]
              [bcc: <value>]
              [subject: <value>]
              [receipt: <0 or 1>]
              [nick: <nick name of SMTP server>]
              [any other custom stuff for the header]
                          <white space>
              <the stuff one wants to email, possibly multi-para stuff>
               
      Note:  - Strictly speaking, what is required is not the 'to:' field as
               such but at least one recipient;  this recipient can be
               specified in either the 'to:', the 'cc:' or the 'bcc:' field. 
             - The header section starts at line 1 and has no line of
               white-space.
             - The order of the headers (above the line of white-space) is
               immaterial.
             - Besides the sending nick, other tmsrc defaults (such as From:)
               can be over-ridden in the send header. 

    Mappings for a Quick Start                      *tms-mappings-quick-start*

      Leaders                               *tms-leaders* *tms-mapping-leader*

        The [vimfiles or ~/.vim]/mail/tms.vim file defines mappings to enable
        a quick start toward using The Mail Suite (tms).  Some of the mappings
        are local to mail buffers, other local to the index file and other
        global.  All but two of the mappings are defined with local or global
        map-leaders.  To simplify writing this quick-start guide, it is
        written assuming that both the local and global map-leader are '/'.

      The Mappings                                              *tms-mappings*

        Getting and Indexing             *tms-getting-indexing* *tms-indexing* 

        \g  Get mail from specified POP servers
            Will prompt for the nicks of the POP servers [default: all servers]

        \i  Index the specified folder (i.e., generate the index.idx file)
            Will prompt for the folder (no default)

        \G  Get mail from all the POP servers
            Index the inbox
            Display the index file of the inbox
        
        The index file can be very wide.  There are two (buffer-local,
        non-leadered) mappings that help horizontally scroll the index file.

        <c-l>  horizontally scroll left
        <c-h>  horizontally scroll right

        Deleting, Moving and Copying             *tms-deleting-moving-copying*
                                                    *tms-moving* *tms-copying*

        The following mappings can be invoked from either a buffer for *.eml
        file or from a buffer of an index file.  The ''mail file'' referred to
        below is either the file of the current .eml buffer or the .eml file
        of the current line in the index file.

        \d  delete the mail file
        \m  move the mail file (will prompt for the destination folder)
        \c  copy the mail file (will prompt for the destination folder)

        The next three mappings are buffer-local to the index file.  They
        accept a range (range can be specified implicitly by visually
        selecting lines in the index file).  They act on all the .eml files of
        the lines specified in the range.

        \D  delete the mail files
        \M  move the mail files
        \C  copy the mail files

        Keep in mind that the interface is editable:  so if the lines of
        interest are not contiguous then one can cut and paste them to be
        contiguous before applying the above maps!

        Opening or Viewing                 *tms-opening-viewing* *tms-viewing*

        Opening or viewing the mails:

        \o  open the mail file of the current line in the index file 
            in a new window.
        \v  Only on MS-Windows machines:  view the mail file of the 
            current line in the index file using the viewer specified 
            for handling .eml files.
        \n  Replace the current .eml buffer with the mail file of the line 
            below the current line in the index file (the ''next'' line)
        \p  Replace the current .eml buffer with the mail file of the line 
            above the current line in the index file (the ''previous'' line)

        Replying, Forwarding and Acknowledging                  
                                       *tms-replying-forwarding-acknowledging*
                                          *tms-forwarding* *tms-acknowledging*

        There are four mappings local to the index buffer for replying,
        replying-to-all, forwarding and acknowledging receipt of the email
        corresponding to the current line.  Executing these mappings creates
        a new buffer appropriately prepared for sending
        (|tms-preparing-to-send-mail|).
        
        \r  reply 
        \R  reply to all 
        \f  forward 
        \A  acknowledge receipt 
       
        Sending                                                  *tms-sending*
        
        Lastly, the following global map is for sending email:
        
        \s  Send the specified buffer or file that has been prepared 
            for sending (|tms-preparing-to-send-mail|)
            Will prompt for the file name [default: current buffer]

  Customization                                            *tms-customization*

    In using the tms, it is important to keep in mind that the full power of
    VIM is always available.  This customization can range from eliminating
    leaders in the mappings, to having the defaults of the mappings be other
    than what they currently are, to adding new mappings such one that gets
    and filters etc.  This is just one aspect of the usefulness of providing
    an application with an Editable User Interface, and with one that is as
    powerful as VI-Improved (|tms-interface-contrasted|).

Migrating from Microsoft          *tms-migrate-from-microsoft-outlook-express*

  This is ALMOST trivial:  First create a tree of folders that parallels the
  tree in Microsoft's email client.  Then, ''drag and drop'' to create .eml
  files in the folders.  Here's the CATCH:  the copy fails when a folder
  contains more than one email with the same subject.

Author                                                            *tms-author*

Claims                                                            *tms-claims*

I came up with the following on my own.

    * The concept of an Editable User Interface (EUI).

    * The conception of The Mail Suite (tms) as an application with an
      Editable User Interface (EUI) using the VI-Improved (VIM) editor
      as its user interface.

    * The format of the index file and the schemes/methods for dealing with
      its columns, their widths and their sorting.

    * The development of tms.

Should you have occasion to discuss or use any of the above, please be sure
to give me due credit.  I thank you.
